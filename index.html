      <h1>Transcribe Patient Visit Dates</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient visit dates in sequential order. The dates 
        follow the order day, month, year. For each image transcribe the date. Give your
        response in the format dd/mm/yyyy, including zeros and adding "20" where necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous dates, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>Patients usually make visits weekly or biweekly, always on the same day of 
              the week, either Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday.</li>
              <li>The years range from 2016 to 2024.</li>
              <li>Dates should be in sequential order. Each date comes after the date before.</li>
              <li>If part of the date is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and 
              select "Incomplete/Unreadable." If the image contains no readable numbers, enter "Blank".</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          If one date is unclear, it is okay to extrapolate from the other images. For example, if the 
          year is unreadable in one image you can infer the year from the images before and after. For tough 
          cases, it may be helpful to skip an image and come back to it once you have completed the rest. If 
          a warning appears but you are <em>sure</em> the date is entered correctly, ignore the warning and click submit.

    <div id="age-instructions" style="display: none;">
      <h1>Transcribe Patient Ages</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient ages at sequential visits. The ages are written in años (years), 
        meses (months), and/or días (days) using the letters "a", "m", and "d" respectively. Enter the age exactly
        as it appears, without spaces, for instance, "2a3m" for 2 years and 3 months or "20d" for 20 days.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous ages, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>The ages are from sequential visits, often one or two weeks apart, so the age
                will usually increase by a few days or weeks. In some cases, a patient might
                not have a visit for months or years, causing a larger jump in age.</li>
              <li>Some images may have the letters "EC" meaning edad coregida (corrected age), 
                which is the age of a child adjusted for prematurity. In these cases, enter "EC" followed by the age.</li>
              <li>If part of the age is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and 
              select "Incomplete/Unreadable." If the image contains no readable numbers, enter "Blank".</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          If one age is unclear, it is okay to extrapolate from the other images. For example, you know each age
          must be between the ages before and after it. For tough cases, it may be helpful to skip an image and 
          come back to it once you have completed the rest. If a warning appears but you are <em>sure</em> 
          the age is entered correctly, ignore the warning and click submit.

    <div id="bmi-instructions" style="display: none;">
      <h1>Transcribe Patient BMI</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient Body Mass Index values recorded at sequential visits. 
        Enter the BMI exactly as it appears, using a comma as the decimal separator (for example, "17,3" 
        not "17.3").
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous BMI values, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>BMI values for children typically range between 9,0 and 30,0. Values outside this range 
                should be double-checked carefully.</li>
              <li>BMI will rarely fluctuate drastically between visits. A normal change in BMI between two 
                consecutive visits is less than 2.</li>
              <li>If part of the BMI value is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and 
                select "Incomplete/Unreadable." If the image contains no readable numbers, enter "Blank".</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          If one BMI is unclear, it is okay to compare it with the values before and after to help confirm. 
          For tough cases, it may be helpful to skip an image and come back to it once you have completed the rest.

      <h1>Transcribe Patient Diagnosis</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain the patient’s nutritional diagnosis written as two abbreviations separated by a dash: 
        first the malnutrition diagnosis, then the height/stunting diagnosis (for example, "DC-DT"). 
        Enter the abbreviated diagnosis exactly as it appears, using uppercase letters, a single dash, and no spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the following key to interpret and transcribe diagnoses:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Malnutrition (first part):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>DG</strong>—desnutrición grave (severe malnutrition)</li>
        <li><strong>DM</strong>—desnutrición moderada (moderate malnutrition)</li>
        <li><strong>DL</strong>—desnutrición leve (mild malnutrition)</li>
        <li><strong>DC</strong>—desnutrición crónica (chronic malnutrition)</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong>—eutrófico (eutrophic; healthy nutritional status)</li>
        <li><strong>S</strong> or <strong>SP</strong>—sobrepeso (overweight)</li>
        <li><strong>O</strong>—obesidad (obesity)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Stunting (second part):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TN</strong>—talla normal (normal height)</li>
        <li><strong>DT</strong>—déficit de talla (mild stunting)</li>
        <li><strong>BT</strong>—baja talla (moderate stunting)</li>
        <li><strong>BTG</strong>—baja talla grave (severe stunting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous diagnoses, follow these guidelines:
        <ul>
          <li>Diagnoses may remain the same across visits or change.</li>
          <li>The diagnosis is likely to become less severe over time, as the child recovers.</li>
          <li>Use only the abbreviations listed in the key above.</li>
          <li>If the diagnosis is written in words instead of an abbreviation, enter 
            the corresponding abbreviation from the list above.</li>
          <li>If part of the diagnosis is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and select "Incomplete/Unreadable." 
              If the image contains no readable letters, enter "Blank".</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        If one diagnosis is unclear, it is okay to compare it with the values before and after 
        to help confirm. If a warning appears but you are <em>sure</em> the transcription 
        is correct, ignore the warning and click submit.

      <h1>Transcribe Patient Height</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient height (length or stature) values in centimeters recorded at sequential visits. 
        Enter the height exactly as it appears, using a comma as the decimal separator (for example, "62,5" 
        not "62.5"). Do not include units (e.g. "cm"); instead, enter just the number.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous heights, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>Some images may include units ("cm"). Ignore the units and just enter the number.</li>
              <li>Typical heights for infants and children in this dataset range from 30,0 to 120,0.</li>
              <li>Heights usually increase over time. A sudden decrease in height is almost always an error.</li>
              <li>If part of the height is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and

      <h1>Transcribe Percentiles</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient percentiles for measures such as height, weight, and head circumference. 
        Percentiles may be written as a plain number (e.g., "95"), with a percent sign (e.g., "95%"), 
        or as a cutoff using a comparator with the letter "P" (e.g., "&gt;P90", "&lt;P3"). If decimals 
        appear, use a comma as the decimal separator (e.g., "97,5%" not "97.5%"). In the case of a percentage 
        with or without a percent sign, enter just the number without a percent sign. In the case of a cutoff 
        value beginning with "P", enter the percentile exactly as written, including the letter P and 
        &gt; or &lt; when present.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous entries, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>Valid percentiles are typically between 1 and 99. Common cutoffs include "&lt;P3", "&lt;P10", "&gt;P90", and "&gt;P97".</li>
              <li>These children are malnourished, so low percentiles are common.</li>

        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient z-scores for a measure such as BMI, weight, height, or head 
        circumference. A z-score measures how a patient compares to an average child their age: a score of 0
        means the child is average, a negative score is below average, and a positive score is above average.
        Enter the z-score exactly as it appears, using a comma as the decimal separator (for example, "-2,35" 
        not "-2.35"). Be sure to include a negative sign if there is one.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous z-scores, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>Z-scores typically fall between -3 and 3. They will almost never be less than -6 or greater than 6.</li>
              <li>The children in this data are malnourished, so they will often have negative z-scores (meaning the child is smaller than average).</li>
              <li>Z-scores will rarely fluctuate drastically between visits. A normal change in z-score between two 
                consecutive visits is less than 0,5.</li>
              <li>If part of the z-score is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and

          If one weight is unclear, it is okay to compare it with the values before and after to help confirm. 
          For tough cases, it may be helpful to skip an image and come back to it once you have completed the rest. 
          If a warning appears but you are <em>sure</em> the weight is entered correctly, ignore the warning and click submit.

      <h1>Transcribe Z-Scores</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        The following images contain patient z-scores for a measure such as BMI, weight, height, or head 
        circumference. A z-score measures how a patient compares to an average child their age: a score of 0
        means the child is average, a negative score is below average, and a positive score is above average.
        Enter the z-score exactly as it appears, using a comma as the decimal separator (for example, "-2,35" 
        not "-2.35"). Be sure to include a negative sign if there is one.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help interpret hard to read or ambiguous z-scores, follow these guidelines:
          <ul>
              <li>Z-scores typically fall between -3 and 3. They will almost never be less than -6 or greater than 6.</li>
              <li>The children in this data are malnourished, so they will often have negative z-scores (meaning the child is smaller than average).</li>
              <li>Z-scores will rarely fluctuate drastically between visits. A normal change in z-score between two 
                consecutive visits is less than 0,5.</li>
              <li>If part of the z-score is cut off or uninterpretable, enter the part you can see and 
              select "Incomplete/Unreadable." If the image contains no readable numbers, enter "Blank".</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
